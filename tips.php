People who are underweight have increased risks for health problems,
 such as weakened immunity, fragile bones, hair loss, anemia and problems with fertility, 
 according to the American Academy of Family Physicians. Children with low BMI may have poor growth and development. 
 To increase your body mass index, or BMI, you’ll have to gain weight.
 If your doctor gives you the okay, start by increasing your calorie intake and exercise regularly.

 Increase Calories<br>
To effectively gain lean body weight, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics 
recommends adding at least 200 extra calories to your meal plan each day. 
Increasing your calories by about 500 per day will help you gain about 1 pound per week.
 Try adding nutrient-dense, high-calorie foods to your diet, such as nuts, seeds, peanut butter, avocados, hummus and vegetable oils. 
 Other healthy choices include whole grains, legumes, lean meats, poultry, seafood, eggs, low-fat dairy foods, soy products, fruits and vegetables.

 Resistance Exercise<br>
Increasing the amount of resistance training, such as weightlifting, you perform will
 help you increase your BMI and gain lean muscle instead of just body fat. 
 The 2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans encourage doing muscle-strengthening exercises
 that involve all major muscle groups at least two times per week. Exercise different muscle groups during each workout.
 For example, you could work your legs and abdominal muscles on Monday, exercise your back and shoulder muscles on Tuesday, 
 rest on Wednesday, exercise your chest and arm muscles on Thursday and work your legs and abdominal muscles again on Friday. 
 Once all your major muscle groups start to increase in size, you should start to gain weight.

 Concerns<br>
If you’ve increased your calorie intake and strength training regimen but still can’t gain weight, 
it may be time to see your doctor. Certain health conditions can lead to underweight BMIs.
 According to the American Academy of Family Physicians, some causes of low body weight include thyroid disorders,
 cancer, other illnesses, certain medications, stress, depression and eating disorders. Depending on the cause of your low BMI,
 you may require medical treatment or counseling to help get it up into a normal, healthy range.
